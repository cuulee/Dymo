Dymo
----

Dymo is a placement script for map labels, pulled from the purpose-built code in [GeoIQ’s Acetate](https://github.com/fortiusone/acetate). Dymo resolves positions for densely-packed point labels, and results in layouts make your maps look like they’ve been [touched by a cartographer](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mmigurski/5194528400/sizes/l/in/photostream/). Dymo is a work in progress, and currently outputs only JSON.

Documentation is forthcoming.
